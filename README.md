# Kerropi's Number Game 
For this week's homework, I was tasked with writing an interactive game where the user is presented a random number, and must use one of four buttons to match the number presented. The catch? The button values are dynamically generated with a number between 1-12 each time a new round starts, and the user has to guess the value of each button. 



TECHNOLOGIES: 
<ul>
<li> HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>Javascript</li>
<li>JQuery</li>
<li>Bootstrap</li>
</ul>

NOTABLE REQUIREMENTS: 
<ul>
<li>The number the user is presented, and the button numbers, are generated using the Math object</li>
<li>The game tracks the total each time the player clicks a button</li>
<li>The player wins when their score matches the random number</li>
<li>Wins and losses are tracked for the session</li>
<li>The game restarts automatically when the player wins or loses </li>
</ul>

KNOWN ISSUES: 


BACKLOG:
